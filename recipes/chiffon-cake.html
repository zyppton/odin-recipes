    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This limoncello poppy seed chiffon cake is a special occasion cake, one I make for the limoncello lovers in my life. I enjoy making homemade limoncello almost as much I enjoy drinking it; but I probably enjoy baking with it even more!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups cake flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>6 large egg yolks, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup limoncello liquor</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Sift cake flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl. Beat on medium speed with an electric mixer until mixture forms soft peaks. With the mixer running, gradually pour in 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue beating until mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, add egg yolks and remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar. Beat until mixture has increased in volume and lightened in color, 3 to 5 minutes. Add in 3/4 cup limoncello, olive oil, 1/4 cup heavy cream, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon zest, and vanilla and mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Pour in 1/2 of the sifted cake flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture plus 1 tablespoon poppy seeds and mix on low speed until just combined. Add in 1/3 of the whipped egg whites, and gently fold in until no streaks of white remain. Add in remaining egg whites and fold gently until no streaks of white remain.</li>
        <li>Place an ungreased 10-inch tube pan with removable bottom onto a baking sheet. Pour batter evenly into the tube pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top of the cake begins to turn golden and feels mostly set, 55 to 65 minutes. Remove pan from oven and invert onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 90 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once cake is cooled, gently run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen. Remove cake, then run knife along the top and center to remove from the pan insert. Place cake onto a serving platter.</li>
        <li>To make glaze, whisk together powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons limoncello, 2 tablespoons heavy cream, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, and 1/8 teaspoon salt until smooth. Pour glaze over cooled cake.</li>
    </ol>
