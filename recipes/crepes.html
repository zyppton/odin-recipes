    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This simple but delicious crêpe recipe can be made in minutes from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
